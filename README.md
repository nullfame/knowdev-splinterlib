# Splinterlib 🔮

Helper library for Splinterlands APIs

## ℹ️ What is Splinterlands?

Splinterlands is a digital NFT collectable card game that runs on the Hive blockchain.
Its a lot like Magic the Gathering.
What makes an NFT/blockchain game different is "true player ownership" of assets.
In other words you can buy, sell, trade, or rent any of your assets with other players.
